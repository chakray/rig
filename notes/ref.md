https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heimdallr

The introductory prose to the poem Rígsþula says that "people say in the old
stories" that Heimdallr, described as a god among the Æsir, once fared on a
journey. Heimdallr wandered along a seashore, and referred to himself as Rígr.
In the poem, Rígr, who is described as a wise and powerful god, walks in the
middle of roads on his way to steads, where he meets a variety of couples and
dines with them, giving them advice and spending three nights at a time between
them in their bed.
